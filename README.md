<h1>CIRC Rover</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The Canadian International Rover Challenge is a competition held every year in Drumheller, Alberta. This event brings together talented college and university STEM students from around the world. Here they have the chance to demonstrate their engineering abilities in robotic systems. The competition challenges the teams to design a space rover capable of overcoming difficult scenarios. These include traversing varying terrain, autonomous operations, and remote dexterity challenges using a robotic arm.

<h2>Software Used</h2>

- <b>SolidWorks</b> 


<h2>Directory structure:</h2>

The project is divided in 3 modules:  <br/>
- <b>1-CNC (Chassis and Suspension)</b>
- <b>2-LYF (Life Detection Dystem)</b>
- <b>3-ARM (Robotic arm)</b> <br/>

With an additional folder <b>"0-ROV"</b> containing the main assembly.

As the leader of the "Chassis and Suspension" division I supervised the progress the design, manufacturing and assembly of the models contained in the folder <b>“1-CNS”</b>.
